# module-roundcornerfix

Fix the round corner display for Mix2s with AOSP PIE based ROM.

By: add an overlay apk to `/system/vendor/overlay` to fix the corner display.

It won't affect your screenshot like some roundcorner apps.

WARNING:Do NOT install this module in MIUI.

Tested on Mix2s with Pixel Experience GSI PIE.
